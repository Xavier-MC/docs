# XavierMC Docs

***Maintenance Required***

This is the repository for all project documentation under the XavierMC umbrella.
Content in this repository is published to [docs.xaviermc.top](https://docs.xaviermc.top) for viewing.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Some file is powered by PaperMC and LeavesMC.

### Installation

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
